# AI-Powered-Image-De-Aging-A-Technical-Exploration
AI-powered image de-aging. This project leverages advanced techniques like ResNet50 for feature extraction, Random Forest for accurate age categorization, and the transformative power of CycleGAN for creating realistic de-aged facial images. Join us on a journey to seamlessly rejuvenate faces while preserving essential characteristicsðŸš€âœ¨.

## Key Features

- **ResNet50 for Feature Extraction**: Utilize ResNet50 architecture to extract high-level features from facial images.
- **Random Forest for Age Categorization**: Train a Random Forest classifier for accurate age categorization based on extracted features.
- **CycleGAN for Realistic De-Aging**: Implement CycleGAN architecture for bidirectional transformation, producing realistic de-aged images.

## Getting Started
